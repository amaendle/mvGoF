Description: Functions for the computation of several goodness of fit
    statistics. Currently impemented are multivariate versions of well known
    EDF statistics: The Anderson-Darling and Cramer-von Mises statistics for
    multivariate uniformly(0,1) distributed data and the bivariate Kolmogorov-
    Smirnov statistic for (0,1) distributed data. Further Rosenblatt's
    transformation for multivariate normally distributed data is implemented, such
    that these tests can be applied as a test for normality.
